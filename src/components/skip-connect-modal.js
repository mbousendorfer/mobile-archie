// "Skip connecting an account?" — the dialog that intercepts the Skip on
// onboarding's account step, reassures, and asks why.
//
// Public API:
//   init()                            — inject markup + bind once on app boot
//   open({ onSkip, onDismiss })
//       onSkip(reasons: string[], comment: string) — the skip is confirmed
//       onDismiss()                                — backed out; the step stands
//
// ── Why intercept a Skip at all ───────────────────────────────────────────
// Under `skipConnectProfiles` the account step is a choice, and the whole bet
// of that feature is that a user who declines here is not lost — the ask comes
// back in the chat flows that draft FOR an account. But nothing anywhere
// records WHY they declined, and that is the one question this step can answer
// that no later surface can: the hesitation is live, and the reasons are not
// interchangeable. "I don't have the admin rights" is an org problem, "I'd
// rather not link our accounts yet" is a trust problem, and "the network isn't
// in the list" is a gap in the product. They need different answers.
//
// So the dialog does two jobs in the order the user needs them:
//   1. REASSURE — what a connected account is actually used for, and what
//      never happens. Most of the hesitation here is about publishing rights,
//      so the three lines answer that before asking anything in return — the
//      third one says the step can be undone.
//   2. ASK — a multi-select, because the reasons genuinely stack (no rights
//      AND someone else handles it AND they'd like to look around first).
//
// ⚠️ Answering is REQUIRED: Skip stays disabled until a box is ticked. That is
// a deliberate departure from topic-ignore-modal, whose reason is optional —
// there, the reason is a bonus on an action the reader already owns; here it is
// the only thing the step gets back for letting the user through, and the same
// user meets this dialog once in their life. Backing out is always free (Back,
// Esc, the backdrop, the X), and it returns to the network grid rather than
// skipping — so the gate is on the SKIP, never on leaving the dialog.
//
// The whole module only ever runs under `skipConnectProfiles`: it is reached
// from the one Skip that flag creates, so it needs no flag test of its own.

// What a connected account is for, and what it doesn't do. Three, because the
// hesitation this dialog meets is almost always about publishing rights.
//
// Each one is a CLAIM plus its detail, not a sentence: the three claims alone
// (69 characters) carry the whole answer for someone who only scans, and the
// captions are there for whoever reads on. The first pass was three two-line
// paragraphs at one weight and one size — 260 characters with no rank, so the
// reader had to read all of it to find out none of it was the question.
//
// Every detail is ≤ 29 characters, which is what holds ONE line in a 170px
// column (33 wraps — measured, not guessed), so the three read as a tidy row
// instead of 1-2-2. And each one ADDS a fact the claim doesn't state: what
// never happens, what is read, how to undo it. A caption that only
// rephrases its claim is the padding this block was full of.
