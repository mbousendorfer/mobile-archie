// ---- Objectives — the data an objective is read from (Insights) -------------
//
// Ported with the Insights feature. Two authored tables, both keyed
// `${contextId}::${objective label}` — the objective's identity is its label,
// the same key `objectiveMeasures` and the alert store use:
//
//   objectiveNextMoves — the ONE recommendation an objective's chat opens on
//   objectivePosts     — the posts drafted with Archie that moved it
//
// Everything else an objective needs (the metric catalogue, the baselines, the
// targets, the trends, the proxies) lives in `objective-measures.js`, because it
// is config that ships with the app rather than seed content.

// ---- Objective next moves (the loop's exit — PP key flow 4) ----------------
//
// An objective's "Work on this" door in Insights — ONE recommendation per
// objective, the way back into creation. Authored here, deterministic, the same discipline as the mock
// crawl: a demo recommendation must be credible and replayable, never generated.
// Keyed `${contextId}::${objective label}`; anything un-authored falls back to
// a generic move derived from the objective's state (objective-flow.js).
//
// `pitch` is the card's sentence — Archie talking, so first person, and it must
// CITE ITS EVIDENCE (a naked "post more" is what this feature exists to avoid).
// `opening` is Archie's first turn in the pre-loaded chat; `angles` seed the
// question picker, phrased as things the user could have typed anyway.

// ---- Archie-drafted posts per objective (Insights) --------------------------
//
// Only posts DRAFTED WITH ARCHIE and published count towards an objective — the
// section under each objective is "what Archie's work moved", not the brand's
// whole feed. No structural post↔objective link exists anywhere else (topPosts
// are account-global, carry no clicks and no metric), so the evidence is
// authored here, keyed `${contextId}::${objective label}` like objectiveNextMoves.
//
//   daysAgo   — relative to TOP_POST_TODAY, so a post lands on the trend curve
//   metricId  — the measure this post moved (one of the objective's)
//   share     — the fraction of that measure's CURRENT value the post accounts
//               for; one objective's rows sum to ≤ 0.6 (Archie never claims the
//               whole number)
//   multiple  — against the brand's 30-day median for that metric
//   figure    — the contribution, pre-formatted, as the card prints it
//   image     — the poster, for an image post: the row that renders these is the
//               winners' own (renderPostEchoRow), which shows the post's picture,
//               so an image post without one rendered a grey square beside a row
//               that had a photo
//
// Un-authored objectives fall to a deterministic generator in the Insights
// model, drawing sentences from objectivePostPool below.
