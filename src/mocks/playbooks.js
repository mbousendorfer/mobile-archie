// both, the way it would if both had been scraped from the same site.
//
// The reversed lockup carries its own dark plate INSIDE the SVG. That's how a
// brand kit presents it, and it's also the only way it survives being shown on a
// white thumbnail tile — a white-on-transparent mark would render as an empty box.

The front door is a complimentary 30-minute one-on-one introduction followed by a free trial period. Local competitors are loud about youth programs, belt promotions and community events; the opening is to explain what those milestones actually build — self-control, problem-solving, resilience — for parents and adults who want capability without aggression.",

Shared calendars, automated moderation and social ROI tracking are the levers — the pitch is saving time, staying organised, and being able to prove the value of the work. Founded in Paris in 2010 by Emeric Ernoult and Benoît Hédiard and bootstrapped since, it shipped the first social media inbox in 2014 and now serves 31K+ social media managers daily. The site argues on four numbers rather than adjectives: 50% of content-creation time saved, 30% average saving for teams switching, 96% user satisfaction, and support answering in 30 minutes or less. Social ROI is the differentiator it claims outright — tracking sales, traffic and leads back to organic posts.",
