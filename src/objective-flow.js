// Launches the in-chat interaction for an OBJECTIVE — the loop's exit (PP
// "Objectives in Archie", key flow 4: steered → acted).
//
// The Insights detail ends on one Next move; its CTA opens a chat pre-loaded
// with the objective, and Archie's first turn carries the diagnosis and the
// angles that answer the weak measure. Same two-half shape as topic-flow.js,
// and for the same reason — the entry point and the choreography live on
// opposite sides of a navigation:
//   • openObjectiveInChat(entry)      — from either detail host: arm the
//     handoff and navigate to a fresh chat, pre-bound to the objective's
//     Playbook and named after it (query params session.js already reads).
//   • startObjectiveChat(sessionId, payload) — consumed at session mount:
//     Archie opens on the diagnosis, then the question picker.
//
// The recommendation itself is resolved by nextMoveFor(): authored in
// mocks.objectiveNextMoves (deterministic, evidence-citing), with a generic
// derivation by objective state as the fallback — so an un-authored objective
// still gets a door, never a dead end.
//
// Version pins MUST match session.js's so the assistant / inline-question
// module instances are shared — each holds per-session state in a module-local
// Map, and a second copy at a different URL would hold its own.
