// Topic feeds — one per Playbook: which sources it listens to, and how often.
//
// GLOBAL, like connectors-store: a feed pairs a Playbook with a set of sources
// and runs on a cadence, long before any chat exists to hold what it finds.
//
// ── Why this is a store and not a field on the Playbook ────────────────────
// The Topics magazine this replaces kept the same config on the Context, as
// `ctx.topics`. It came off for the reason CONCEPTS.md §1 gives: a Playbook is
// an identity sheet — every field answers "who are you?" — and which feeds are
// live and how often they run answers "what job should Archie run?". That is
// operational, and the settings PAGE it is edited on was already a route scoped
// to one feature rather than a section of the fiche. Moving the data to match
// the surface costs nothing and stops the fiche growing a config block.
//
// It also buys `websites`, which has nowhere to live on a Context: the
// Playbook's own `websiteUrl` is the brand's canonical address, while this is
// the scan list for one feed, which may add a blog, a docs site or a regional
// domain the brand record has no business holding.
//
// Public API:
//   getFeeds()               → Feed[]  (creation order — nothing reshuffles)
//   getFeedById(id)          → Feed | null
//   getFeedForPlaybook(id)   → Feed | null   (there is exactly one)
//   updateFeed(id, patch)    → Feed | null
//   subscribe(fn)            → unsubscribe
//
// Feed shape (see mocks.topicFeeds):
//   { id, name, playbookId,
//     sources: string[],   — enabled source ids, from topics-catalog
//     cadence,             — a CADENCES id; copy, never a timer
//     websites: string[] } — the sites the Brand-website source scans
