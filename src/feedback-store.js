// feedback-store — central, in-memory record of what the user tells us: their
// verdicts on the things Archie generates (drafts, images, clips), and their
// reasons when a step asks for one. One flat Map keyed by a stable `targetId`
// string the caller mints per element:
//
//   draft:<postId>          — a generated post draft
//   image:<postId>:<seed>   — a generated image (seed so Regenerate = fresh target)
//   clip:<clipId>           — an extracted video clip
//   skip:connect-profiles   — why onboarding's account step was skipped
//
// Each record holds the thumb verdict plus the optional "what was off?"
// detail collected on a thumbs-down (reason chips + free-text comment). A
// record written by `recordReasons` carries the same reasons + comment shape
// with no verdict at all — it answers a question rather than rating a result,
// so there is no thumb to hold. Those targetIds live in their own namespace
// (`skip:`), so nothing that renders a thumb ever reads one.
//
// This is a prototype: there is no backend. We keep the votes in memory so
// the UI can reflect them across re-renders, and `console.info` each one so
// the "data we would collect" is visible in the dev console. No localStorage
// persistence (matches the rest of the app's app-state policy).
