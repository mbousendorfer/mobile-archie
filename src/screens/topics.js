// /topics — the Topic Feed: a queue you triage, with the article beside it.
//
// ── Scope ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// One Playbook at a time. WHICH one depends on one flag, and the two answers
// were both written against the same failure.
//
// Flag OFF: `?pb=`. The version this was ported from had a module that owned the
// app's scope, persisted it, and was written to by a select sitting in this
// page's filter bar — so a control that promised a page filter silently
// re-scoped the sidebar, the next new chat and the composer's picker. `?pb=`
// says the same thing, survives a link, and stops at this screen. The settings
// page reads the same param, so the scope survives the round trip both ways.
//
// Flag `playbookWorkspace` ON: the ACTIVE Playbook, and `?pb=` is not read at
// all. What was wrong with the port was not that the scope was global, it was
// that it was HIDDEN behind a page control; a permanent switcher at the top of
// the rail is the other half of that bargain. This page's own scope select then
// own scope select then disappears entirely — see the toolbar.
//
// ── The layout ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Master–detail, and the split is measured with a @container query on the row
// itself rather than a media query: the sidebar collapses and the right panel
// overlays, so viewport width never tells you content width.
//
// The list SHRINKS when the article opens. That is the fix for the port's worst
// bug: with the list pinned at a fixed 666px the article had nowhere to go under
// ~1180px of content width, so at 1440px of viewport — a 14" laptop — clicking a
// card rendered the article 1900px below the fold and nothing appeared to happen.
//
// ── Paging ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Ten at a time, and the last page's sentinel loads the next when it scrolls into
// view. There is an explicit Load more too, and both do exactly the same thing —
// an infinite list with no button is unusable by keyboard.

// each answering one question, each its own field in the filter:
//
//   Topics    a multi-select on `kind`, EMPTY at rest — both lanes show in one
//             list (To review, the active lane, and For later, the parked one).
//             Ticking a lane narrows to it; a For-later Topic is told apart in the
//             mixed list by its own blue "For later" chip, not by a card change.
//             ⚠️ This replaced a one-lane-at-a-time RADIO (`git log -S
//             renderKindRadio`) and, before it, tabs above the list (`renderTabs`)
//             — the arbitration changed: read both by default, narrow if you want.
//   Marked as a multi-select on the ANSWERED statuses — Already used / Ignored —
//             opted into on top of the To-review baseline the list already shows.
//   Sources   a multi-select on the listening source, live ones tickable and the
//             rest "Coming soon".
//
// ⚠️ TRENDING / UPDATED ARE NOT HERE. They are card chips, not filter rows: a
// signal is a claim about NOW, not a lane, and there is no "show me only what is
// spiking". Dropping them from the filter is what lets the ignored rule fall out
// for free — the predicate never reads a signal, so one can never resurface an
// ignored Topic (topics-store matchesFilters). `git log -S renderStateSelect` has
// the flat-filter version; `git log -S renderTabs` the tabbed one before it.

// repaint the way `view.filtersOpen` does, and the summary's click is intercepted
// so the native toggle cannot desync from it.
