// Topic Feed settings — route /topics/settings.
//
// Which listening sources are live for a Playbook, how often the feed runs, and
// which sites the Brand-website source reads.
//
// A SETTINGS PAGE, not a tab beside the feed. A tab gives this equal billing with
// the feed, and that is wrong for what it is: you set your sources once and then
// read Topics for months. The feed is the destination; this is somewhere you visit
// occasionally and leave.
//
// It is NOT a return of the aggregated Settings page that has been reverted four
// times here — the project rule allows config on the entity that owns it OR on a
// route scoped to one feature, and this is the second. The data lives in
// topic-feeds-store, keyed by Playbook; only the surface is here.
//
// ONE Playbook at a time, scoped by `?pb=` — the same param the feed filters on,
// so filtering the feed to a brand and opening settings lands on that brand, and
// the topbar's back carries it home again. Under `playbookWorkspace` the rail
// owns the scope instead: `?pb=` is not read, the page's own Playbook select
// states the brand rather than offering the others, and nothing writes the param
// any more. Stacking a block per Playbook was the
// first shape this page ever had and it does not scale: at twenty Playbooks that
// is 160 switches with each of the eight descriptions repeated twenty times, and
// it is the descriptions, not the switches, that make such a page explode.
//
// Chrome follows the DS settings recipe (`--sys-settings-*`). The shape: a light
// labelled toolbar for the two page-level controls, then ONE CARD PER SOURCE in
// two columns. A card can carry that source's own options — which Brand website
// now does — and a row cannot without turning the list into a form. No save bar:
// every control commits immediately through updateFeed.
