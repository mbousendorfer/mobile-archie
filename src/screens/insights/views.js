// ---- Insights — the three readings, and which one is on screen ----------------
//
// The catalogue (`LAYOUTS`) and the reader's choice (localStorage) live here,
// apart from the shell, because TWO modules need them: the screen, which paints
// the chosen layout, and the topbar, which renders the switch. The shell
// imports the topbar, so a switch owned by the shell would have made the
// topbar import it back — a cycle for one string.
//
// ⚠️ The switch is PROTOTYPE chrome, not product UI. Each layout is one answer
// to "how do I read my objectives", kept side by side to be compared live; the
// day one wins, the others are a delete and this module goes with them. That is
// exactly why the control sits in the topbar and not in the page: the page is
// the thing being evaluated, and a comparison control standing inside it reads
// as one of the page's own features.
//
// There are THREE left, of six. Cockpit is the app's own — a 340px column of
// objectives beside the one you read. The two `mob_` ones were drawn from what
// the market actually ships for goal dashboards (Asana, Monarch, Customer.io,
// Deel, Front, Plane): Index removes the selector from the read entirely (two
// levels, and the index itself is a grid of cards), Side moves the narrow column
// to the right and fills it with facts instead of navigation. Those two share
// their fiche — see read.js.
//
// THREE WERE DELETED on 2026-09-11, in the order they lost, and deleted outright
// rather than kept as choices — which is the intended end of this switch: a
// lecture that loses is a delete, not a flag.
//   • Mob · Band   — the figures beside the curve, the selector down to one tab
//                    strip.
//   • Cockpit bis  — the same master–detail as Cockpit, rotated: the objectives
//                    as a band of tiles across the top, one read at full width.
//   • Report       — one objective at a time behind a tab strip, its hero
//                    carrying the rollup.
// `insights-read.css` and `read.js` say they are deletable as a block the day
// one reading wins; that day is closer than it was.

/**
 * The switch, as the topbar wears it — far right, where /topics puts its cog
 * and a session puts its panel pills: the app's canonical home for a
 * page-level control.
 *
 * It is a ghost button in the topbar's own vocabulary (icon + label, like the
 * Sources / Ideas / Drafts pills beside it), carrying the CURRENT reading's
 * glyph and name so the resting state answers "which view am I in" without
 * being opened. Only the menu is the DS select's (`.ap-select-dropdown` /
 * `-options` / `-option`), so an option row reads the same as in every other
 * picker in the app.
 *
 * It used to be a labelled 180px "View" field in a page bar of its own. Two
 * things were wrong with that: it spent a row of the page on prototype chrome,
 * and it stood beside "New objective" — the page's one real primary — as if
 * the two were the same kind of thing.
