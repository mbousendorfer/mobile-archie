// ---- Insights — the read stack the mob_ lectures share -------------------------
//
// Both `mob_` readings (Index / Side) render THE SAME objective fiche; what
// differs is how they arrange its blocks — Index stacks them behind a crumb,
// Side deports three of them into a right-hand column. So the blocks live here,
// one function each, and the hosts compose them. (Band was the third host until
// it was deleted on 2026-09-11.) Same idea as `pieces.js`, one rung up: pieces owns the
// vocabulary (a verdict is a DS status pill, everywhere), this owns the SECTIONS
// that vocabulary is assembled into.
//
// ⚠️ Cockpit is deliberately NOT re-pointed at this module. It is the reference
// the mob_ lectures are being compared against,
// and rewriting them would invalidate the comparison — so their own copies of
// this stack stay exactly as they are. The duplication is the price of an
// intact baseline, and it ends the day one reading wins: the losers and this
// module are deleted together.
//
// THE FICHE IS A PAGE HEADER OVER ONE REPORT CARD PER MEASURE. That is prod's
// own arrangement: in Reports a page is a HEADER naming its subject and then a
// stack of `Card / Report card (to detach)` (Figma `Analytics - Shared
// components`, node 1070:7477), ONE PER METRIC — each with its own grey band
// (name · description · a white synthesis box of that metric's figures) over
// its own white body (that metric's chart).
//
// So `Brand awareness` is the page's title, and `Reach` and `Brand mentions`
// are two self-contained blocks under it. What that deletes, and it is the
// point: the five-column measures table, its counter, and the SELECTOR — with
// every measure charted in its own card there is nothing left to switch. Three
// rounds of design went into where that selector should sit (a DS tab strip
// over the chart, then rows above it, then rows below it, rejected); the answer
// turned out to be that a page with two measures doesn't need one.
//
// Pure render helpers — strings in, strings out, no listeners. Every action is
// a `data-ins-*` hook the shell dispatches (shell.js § Actions).

// ── The hero ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The page's header plate, and the one block on this screen that is allowed to
// be a hero: the objective's name at the DS's TOP rung (h1, 24/32 — the ramp
// stops there, and a bigger step would be a number invented for one page), its
// verdict beside it, the answer in one sentence under it, and the facts that
// identify it at the caption rung below that.
//
// The hierarchy is the whole design: 24 bold navy → 16 regular grey-80 → 12
// regular grey-80. Three sizes, three weights, one ink pair — which is how this
// app ranks things ("hiérarchiser par taille, graisse, encre"), rather than by
// tinting a band or drawing a rule between rows.
//
// The verbs sit on the title's line, right-aligned, where prod's report card
// holds `Download chart`.
//
// ⚠️ THE LEDE IS PERMANENT AGAIN, and that reverses a note this file carried.
// The prose was demoted to a fallback when it was the THIRD statement of the
// same fact on one page — the hero's figure row said it in numerals, the table
// row in columns, the pill in a word. Both of those are gone from the hero: the
// numbers moved into each measure's own report card, where the figure and the
// curve that produced it are one block. So the hero has no numeral left, and a
// header that prints only a name and a coloured pill says nothing about how the
// objective is doing. One sentence at the top, the numbers in the cards below:
// that is a hierarchy, not a repetition — and it is prod's own anatomy, whose
// report card carries a description under its title (Figma 1069:7931).

// ── One measure, one report card ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The block, transcribed from Figma `Analytics - Shared components` →
// `Card / Report card (to detach)` (1070:7477) and its head
// `Card / Title+synthesis` (1069:7931), with the geometry read off the file
// rather than guessed: band padding 24, the white synthesis box inset in it at
// padding 16, its cells separated by a 1px × 40 rule with 24 either side.
//
// The card is ONE measure:
//   • band — the metric's name at the h3 rung (the objective owns h1, one rung
//     up, in the page header), its scope in prod's description slot, its state
//     pill where prod holds `Download chart`;
//   • the synthesis box — `Progress` as the 38px numeral (the platform's
//     `.main-data`, borrowed from `Card / Key metrics` 432:6310, whose `Value`
//     is a big figure), then `Current`, `Target` and `Variation`, one fact per
//     cell, prod's label-over-value. The four labels read as a row because the
//     cells are top-aligned, and they are all NOUNS — `Progress`, not "of
//     target", which only reads right AFTER its figure, not above it;
//   • body — that measure's curve, full width, and nothing else.
//
// ⚠️ No sub-title over the chart. Prod has one (`Engagement overview` under
// `Engagement`), which is prod naming the same metric twice; the card's band
// already says `Reach` forty pixels above the plot.
//
// ⚠️ The lead cell falls back to the CURRENT VALUE when a measure has no
// progress to show — `progressPct` is null for the lower-is-better metrics — and
// the `Current` cell then drops, because a big `—` over a number that is right
// there is a hole where the answer should be.
//
// `specs` is the map the host hands to `mountCharts` after the innerHTML lands;
// the chart nodes are placeholders until then, which is what keeps these
// functions free of DOM.
