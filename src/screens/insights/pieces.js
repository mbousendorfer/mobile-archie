// ── The page's head — the scope, worn as the heading ─────────────────────
//
// Insights reads ONE Playbook, and its head is where you change which. That is
// not a decoration: the rail's own scope switcher is parked (see the commented
// block in sidebar.js), so this is the only door to the scope anywhere in the
// app, and a dashboard you cannot re-point is a dashboard of one brand.
//
// So the heading IS the scope: the Playbook's name at the h2 rung with a
// chevron after it, opening the DS select's own option list. Every layout puts
// it where it used to print the word "Objectives" — the rail's head, the band's
// title, the Report hero — and the page bar no longer carries a Playbook field.
//
// ⚠️ This is a deliberate reversal. The title-with-a-chevron was tried, dropped
// for "a title that is secretly a picker reads as neither", and the scope became
// a labelled select beside the title. The reversal is the user's call, and what
// makes it safe is that the picker is not secret: the chevron is always
// visible, the hit area lights up on hover, and the arrow turns blue — the
// interactive colour — so the heading declares itself a control. What it buys
// is the word the heading spends: "Objectives" labelled a list the counts and
// the tabs under it already name, while the brand the whole page is about was
// printed once, small, in a form field.

/**

 * ⚠️ In WORKSPACE MODE it renders NOTHING, and the hosts treat the empty string

 * topbar's own title, so a page that re-prints it spends its first 87px saying
 * what the chrome already said — and the page's own subject (`Objectives`, or
 * the objective being read) never gets the top of the screen. The hosts put
 * that subject there instead: `pageTitle()` below.
 *

 * Don'ts in one span — a Tag names an entity a user can create, its colours
 * name an object TYPE, and `mini` is for inline references in running text.)
 *
 * Infobox was ruled out then as "page-level and dismissible". Its close button
 * is a part you leave out (`.ap-infobox-close`), and the whole point of the
 * component is a state that needs explaining — so the objection was about a
 * variant, not the component.

 * several" under a table; the section is now a grid of the real cards, so what
 * a post looks like is decided in one place for both surfaces.

 * Three slots are ours, because they are the only things the two hosts measure
 * differently:
 *   • the stat strip — this post's contribution to the measure and its share of

 *   • the CTA — **Repurpose**, the loop's other end, since a post that moved an
 *     objective is the best brief for the next one. Same blue primary the board
 *     gives it, carrying `data-ins-*` so this screen's own dispatch answers.
 *
 * `--neutral` keeps the multiple in INK instead of the board's green. Green
 * means "on track" on this screen, and a green multiple inside an off-track
 * objective would read as reassurance — the board has no such vocabulary to
